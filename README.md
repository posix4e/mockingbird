a collection of globity goop for brave. I don't see why we can't have electron and brave packages across all of the free platforms. Also why not have badass level 1 and level 2 sandboxing. 

## TBD
- [ ] [hack and slack](hack_and_slash.md) the sandbox from electron over to brave.
- [x] jessie Vagrant 
- [ ] jessie SRC-DEB
- [ ] jessie RFP
- [ ] Investigate OpenSuse/Fedora
- [ ] Confirm Setuid's questionable safety record
